# sortjs
a small read/unique/sort script for text files that uses native/natural sorting with full Unicode support.


will sort and unique a 6MB file in about ~30 seconds.

the `sort.cmd` file is if you'll want to include the directory in your path and simply call `sort` (no extension) with the file argument, 
the use of `index.cmd` and `index.js` is a nodejs convention/standard naming I keep.
